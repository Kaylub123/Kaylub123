Hello, If ur reading this then ive probably been missing for 1 month in real life.


On 11/5/2021 I took my own life
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. Thank you for being with me.
The support and love and friends ive made have kept me going as long as I have.
I deffinitely wouldnt be writing this if you werent here for me.
 
I wanted to keep going until I finished all my projects, but I wont ever be finished with them haha.
My work is one of the few things I can find joy in, and im glad I was able to share it with you.
 
Im sorry if you expected something more personal
My brother has been struggling lately, Well this is the last time u will hear from me.
 
Good night
